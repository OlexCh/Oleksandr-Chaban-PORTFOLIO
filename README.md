# PORTFOLIO
## About me
### &emsp; My name is Oleksandr Chaban. I want to become a QA Engineer because I like making products better.

<h3>&emsp;I have many years of experience in telecommunications
and financial technology sector.
During my work with clients, I realized that clients are interested in reliable product
quality. I also understand that offering a product that has not been thoroughly
tested may damage the product owner's reputation and impact sales.<br/>
Thus, It is crucial to discover the true state of a product and improve it to meet the expectations of the consumer.</h3>
